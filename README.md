# ToSurface
ToSurface is an experimental interaction that aims to enhance physical-virtual co-existence in AR. In spite of the fidelity of computer-generated characters interacting with the surrounding physical environment, the physicals maintain calm and we would not notice their presence without the lens of AR. What if the virtual objects could make a physical influence? What would it be like to feel the realistic vibrations of rainfall or animated characters jumping on a table? The physical response of the AR animation is translated via a haptic puck that contains 4 vibrators inside. The puck creates a directional vibratory feedback based on the locations of the puck and the animation.
